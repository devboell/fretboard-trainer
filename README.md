### Fretboard

A trainer app that helps you learn your guitar fretboard inside out. You can teach yourself all the notes, intervals, scales and triads. It will include ascending and descending intervals, triad-inversions, all the standard extended chords (7ths, 11ths, 13ths etc.) and their inversions.

There will be configureable trainging sets, where you can review your fretboard knowledge based not just on note or chord names, but sheet notation and tones (sound) as well. So this is also very good for sight-reading and ear-training.

This is a work in progress, but you can check what I have so far: https://fretboard-trainer.herokuapp.com/. I'd be happy to get feedback on the app or the code, so feel free to open an issue and tell me what you think.
